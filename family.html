		<p style="text-align:center and justify; font-size:80;"> This is my family. This picture was taken last year during eid al-Fitr with my grandparents which are "tok" and "wan". As you can see, I have my parents that I call "mama" and "abah". I also have two little brother and I am the first and the only daughter in my family. My nickname in my family is "Dahlia" and "kakak".</p>

	     <img src="imagee/parent.jpg" width="190" height="280" border="2">
		<p style="text-align:center and justify; font-size:80;"> This is my parents. The interesting fact is my mom from Indonesia. These two person are the reason why I pursue my study and did not give up in my life. They always encourge me to the all my best and they always support me. Whenever I feel like I want to give up in my study and my life, I always remember their struggle to raise me especially in this economy. I want to repay the services and struggles of my parents. Without them, I am nothing.</p>

	     <img src="imagee/littlebrothers.jpg" width="210" height="280" border="2">
		<p style="text-align:center and justify; font-size:80;">This is my two little brothers. The tall one is Adib and he is the second child in my family while the boy that have the same height with me is Amzar and he is the last child in my family.They are both the inspiration of my life. Even though we siblings often fight, I love them very much and I am willing to do anything to take care of them and make them happy. They both often take care of me when I want to leave the house or have problems. I am proud to be their older sister because they taught me the meaning of brotherhood and I hope our sibling relationship will never end. </p>

	     <img src="imagee/adib.jpg" width="150" height="280" border="2">
		<p style="text-align:center and justify; font-size:80;"> This is my little brother name Adib. He is 18 years old and he will taking Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia(SPM) this year. Although he looks fierce but he is really protective and quite soft-hearted. This is my younger brother who always takes care of me wherever I am and he is always my loyal listener when I am in trouble. I really hope he becomes a successful person in this world and the hereafter. Although we both often fight, we love each other and are always there for each other. </p>

	     <img src="imagee/amzar.jpg" width="185" height="260" border="2">
		<p style="text-align:center and justify; font-size:80;"> This is my little brother name Amzar but I always call him as adik because he is the last child in my family and he is really clingy. He is 13 years old this year.My younger brother's personality is very different from Adib's but they are very close. He is a very spoiled and very easygoing person. I always pray that he will be obedient to his parents and successful in this world and the hereafter. He is also someone who easily accepts advice and is always entertaining. May our relationship as siblings last forever. </p>
