	<img src="imagee/dua'.jpg" "center" width="450" height="290" border="3">
	   <p style="text-align:center and justify; font-size:80;"> This is one of my favorite dua '/ prayers that I always practice in my daily life. It strengthens faith in Allah's power to respond to supplications and it can bring  relief from any frustration or any bad feeling. This dua' is about Yunus AS tried to show them the foolishness in idolatry and destructive path they were on. But they ignored him. Yunus AS decided himself that they were beyond saving and his efforts would be appreciated elsewhere, so he left. Yunus AS denied his responsibility without Allah’s consent and sailed away. Allah SWT sent a storm for Yunus AS because he could not deny his destiny. He would need to reconcile and repent. A whale came to the surface and swallowed Yunus AS who was thrown overboard and took him into deep waters where he was engulfed into three layers of darkness which are the night, the sea, and inside the belly of the whale. Here he recited this du’a for forgiveness.</p>
